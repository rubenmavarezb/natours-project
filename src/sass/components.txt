In order to organize the files in a better way I did'nt create a component directory in the sass directory, 
instead I decided to create a sass file for each React component, wraping them in a directory as well, so when you want to edit
the styles of that component, you just need to search for that component in the component directory.
(except for the headings and paragraph components that the scss files are in the _typography.scss file)

The imports of the components are done in main.scss to maintain the consistency.
